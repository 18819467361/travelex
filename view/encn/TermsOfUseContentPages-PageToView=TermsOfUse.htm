<h3>Fraudulent emails</h3>
<div><p>Travelex has become aware of a number of attempted email frauds, in which sellers on online auction sites receive an email claiming to be from Travelex and containing the Travelex logo, requesting that sellers make a cash transfer or ship their goods, in advance of payment. In some cases, these emails also request personal information from sellers such as name, address, etc. Should you receive such an email, please disregard it. Travelex will never request that anyone make a payment in order to facilitate a further payment from a buyer to a seller.</p>
<p>Travelex is also aware of an email fraud which involves offers of fake employment or training opportunities with Travelex. Please note this is not a legitimate Travelex initiative and is an attempt to obtain personal information from individuals including bank account details which will be compromised and used for illegal purposes. Under no circumstances should you provide any personal information including bank account details to these fraudsters who have no connection whatsoever with the Travelex organisation.</p>
<p>If you have provided your banking information you should report this immediately to your banking institution. Legitimate Travelex e-mails will only come from @travelex.com.cn @travelex.com.au @apac.travelex.com or @travelex.com addresses, and we will never ask you for your bank details via email.</p>
<p>Travelex has notified the relevant law enforcement authorities of both frauds.</p>
